# MobilityMapBuilder
This is the software that I produced during my master thesis @ iCub Facility(Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia).
This program takes a pointcloud as input and build the mobility map of the scene using the information of the slope and roughness of each cloud's segment.
It has been tested using point clouds acquired through Asus Xtion Pro Live.
##Requirements
MobilityMapBuilder requires cmake, PCL, OpenCV and CGAL to build.

- cmake https://cmake.org/
- Point Cloid Library http://pointclouds.org/
- OpenCV http://opencv.org/
- CGAL http://www.cgal.org/
